> ✨ **Jesse-Adv** extends the [Jesse trading framework](https://jesse.trade) with Reinforcement Learning, exchange API support (Binance, KuCoin), and a test-train pipeline powered by Stable-Baselines3.

---

Jesse is an advanced crypto trading framework that aims to **simplify** **researching** and defining **YOUR OWN trading strategies** for backtesting, optimizing, and live trading.

## What is Jesse?
Watch this video to get a quick overview of Jesse:

[![Jesse Overview](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0EqN3OOqeJM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EqN3OOqeJM)

## Jesse-Adv
**Jesse-Adv** builds upon the original [Jesse framework](https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse) to enable:
- Reinforcement learning (via Stable-Baselines3)
- Custom `TradingEnv` for Gym-compatible agents
- Real market integration via Binance and KuCoin APIs
- Easy model training, testing, and evaluation
- Future-ready architecture for real-time algo-trading

## Why Jesse?
In short, Jesse is more **accurate** than other solutions, and way more **simple**. 
In fact, it is so simple that in case you already know Python, you can get started today, in **matter of minutes**, instead of **weeks and months**. 

## Key Features

- 📝 **Simple Syntax**: Define both simple and advanced trading strategies with the simplest syntax in the fastest time.
- 📊 **Comprehensive Indicator Library**: Access a complete library of technical indicators with easy-to-use syntax.
- 📈 **Smart Ordering**: Supports market, limit, and stop orders, automatically choosing the best one for you.
- ⏰ **Multiple Timeframes and Symbols**: Backtest and livetrade multiple timeframes and symbols simultaneously without look-ahead bias.
- 🔒 **Self-Hosted and Privacy-First**: Designed with your privacy in mind, fully self-hosted to ensure your trading strategies and data remain secure.
- 🛡️ **Risk Management**: Built-in helper functions for robust risk management.
- 📋 **Metrics System**: A comprehensive metrics system to evaluate your trading strategy's performance.
- 🔍 **Debug Mode**: Observe your strategy in action with a detailed debug mode.
- 🔧 **Optimize Mode**: Fine-tune your strategies using AI, without needing a technical background.
- 📈 **Leveraged and Short-Selling**: First-class support for leveraged trading and short-selling.
- 🔀 **Partial Fills**: Supports entering and exiting positions in multiple orders, allowing for greater flexibility.
- 🔔 **Advanced Alerts**: Create real-time alerts within your strategies for effective monitoring.
- 🤖 **JesseGPT**: Jesse has its own GPT, JesseGPT, that can help you write strategies, optimize them, debug them, and much more.
- 🔧 **Built-in Code Editor**: Write, edit, and debug your strategies with a built-in code editor.
- 📺 **Youtube Channel**: Jesse has a Youtube channel with screencast tutorials that go through example strategies step by step.

## Additions on Jesse with this repo - 
### 📦 Reinforcement Learning
Train RL agents using PPO (or any SB3 algorithm) with a `TradingEnv` built on top of Jesse’s backtesting engine.

- `train_rl.py`: Train a model with synthetic or historical candles
- `test_rl.py`: Evaluate trained models across multiple episodes
- `rl_env.py`: Custom `gym.Env` wrapper for RL agent interaction

### 🔗 Real Exchange Support
Modular support for **real-time candles** using public APIs:
- `jesse/exchanges/binance.py`
- `jesse/exchanges/kucoin.py`
- `jesse/exchanges/exchange_api.py` – abstraction layer

### 🧪 Model Lifecycle
- Save checkpoints (`ppo_trading_model.zip`)
- Evaluate cumulative reward and return
- TensorBoard-compatible logs
## Dive Deeper into Jesse's Capabilities

### Stupid Simple
Craft complex trading strategies with remarkably simple Python. Access 300+ indicators, multi-symbol/timeframe support, spot/futures trading, partial fills, and risk management tools. Focus on logic, not boilerplate.

```python
class GoldenCross(Strategy):
    def should_long(self):
        # go long when the EMA 8 is above the EMA 21
        short_ema = ta.ema(self.candles, 8)
        long_ema = ta.ema(self.candles, 21)
        return short_ema > long_ema

    def go_long(self):
        entry_price = self.price - 10        # limit buy order at $10 below the current price
        qty = utils.size_to_qty(self.balance*0.05, entry_price) # spend only 5% of my total capital
        self.buy = qty, entry_price                 # submit entry order
        self.take_profit = qty, entry_price*1.2  # take profit at 20% above the entry price
        self.stop_loss = qty, entry_price*0.9   # stop loss at 10% below the entry price
```

## ✨ Sample RL Strategy Environment

```python
obs, _ = env.reset()
done = False

while not done:
    action, _ = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
    done = terminated or truncated
    env.render()
```

### Backtest
Execute highly accurate and fast backtests without look-ahead bias. Utilize debugging logs, interactive charts with indicator support, and detailed performance metrics to validate your strategies thoroughly.

### Live/Paper Trading
Deploy strategies live with robust monitoring tools. Supports paper trading, multiple accounts, real-time logs & notifications (Telegram, Slack, Discord), interactive charts, spot/futures, DEX, and a built-in code editor.

### Benchmark
Accelerate research using the benchmark feature. Run batch backtests, compare across timeframes, symbols, and strategies. Filter and sort results by key performance metrics for efficient analysis.

### AI
Leverage our AI assistant even with limited Python knowledge. Get help writing and improving strategies, implementing ideas, debugging, optimizing, and understanding code. Your personal AI quant.

### Optimize Your Strategies
Unsure about optimal parameters? Let the optimization mode decide using simple syntax. Fine-tune any strategy parameter with the Optuna library and easy cross-validation.

```python
@property
def slow_sma(self):
    return ta.sma(self.candles, self.hp['slow_sma_period'])

@property
def fast_sma(self):
    return ta.sma(self.candles, self.hp['fast_sma_period'])

def hyperparameters(self):
    return [
        {'name': 'slow_sma_period', 'type': int, 'min': 150, 'max': 210, 'default': 200},
        {'name': 'fast_sma_period', 'type': int, 'min': 20, 'max': 100, 'default': 50},
    ]
```
