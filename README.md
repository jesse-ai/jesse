## Dive Deeper into Jesse's Capabilities

### Stupid Simple
Craft complex trading strategies with remarkably simple Python. Access 300+ indicators, multi-symbol/timeframe support, spot/futures trading, partial fills, and risk management tools. Focus on logic, not boilerplate.

```python
class GoldenCross(Strategy):
    def should_long(self):
        # go long when the EMA 8 is above the EMA 21
        short_ema = ta.ema(self.candles, 8)
        long_ema = ta.ema(self.candles, 21)
        return short_ema > long_ema

    def go_long(self):
        entry_price = self.price - 10        # limit buy order at $10 below the current price
        qty = utils.size_to_qty(self.balance*0.05, entry_price) # spend only 5% of my total capital
        self.buy = qty, entry_price                 # submit entry order
        self.take_profit = qty, entry_price*1.2  # take profit at 20% above the entry price
        self.stop_loss = qty, entry_price*0.9   # stop loss at 10% below the entry price
```

### Backtest
Execute highly accurate and fast backtests without look-ahead bias. Utilize debugging logs, interactive charts with indicator support, and detailed performance metrics to validate your strategies thoroughly.

### Optimize Your Strategies
Unsure about optimal parameters? Let the optimization mode decide using simple syntax. Fine-tune any strategy parameter with the Optuna library and easy cross-validation.

```python
@property
def slow_sma(self):
    return ta.sma(self.candles, self.hp['slow_sma_period'])

@property
def fast_sma(self):
    return ta.sma(self.candles, self.hp['fast_sma_period'])

def hyperparameters(self):
    return [
        {'name': 'slow_sma_period', 'type': int, 'min': 150, 'max': 210, 'default': 200},
        {'name': 'fast_sma_period', 'type': int, 'min': 20, 'max': 100, 'default': 50},
    ]
```
